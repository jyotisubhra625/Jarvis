<h3>How to Use Jarvis</h3>

<p>
Initialization: Run the script by typing python jarvis.py in your terminal. Wait for the assistant to initialize. You will hear "Initializing Jarvis...." and then "Ya" when it's ready.
Activation: Say "Jarvis" to activate the assistant. This is the wake word that triggers the assistant to listen for commands.
Issuing Commands: Once activated, you can issue voice commands to perform various tasks. Here are some examples:
Web Browsing: Say "Open Google", "Open Facebook", "Open YouTube", or "Open LinkedIn" to open the corresponding website.
Music Playback: Say "Play [song name]" to play a song from the predefined music library.
News Fetching: Say "News" to fetch the latest news headlines.
AI Responses: Ask any question or provide a prompt to get a response from the Google Generative AI model.
Listening Mode: The assistant will listen for commands for a short period (2 seconds) after activation. If you need more time, you can adjust the timeout and phrase_time_limit parameters in the r.listen() function.
